            <p>
            Saying goodbye is never easy, especially when it’s to colleagues who’ve become like family. 
            As I bid farewell, I wanted this moment to reflect the vibrant memories we’ve shared and the 
            bonds we’ve built.

            In parting, I embarked on a fascinating project as part of my NLP class presentation. Drawing 
            inspiration from our WhatsApp group conversations, I analyzed our interactions to create a 
            digital reflection of our time together.

            ### The Journey Behind the Data
            It all began with extracting and cleaning WhatsApp data—a challenge I tackled using Regex. 
            From this cleaned data, I generated a word cloud, revealing frequently used words that sparked 
            nostalgia. Unsurprisingly, words like "class," "thank you," and "poll" topped the list, 
            symbolizing our collective spirit. Our class decisions often hinged on polls, as we humorously 
            avoided centralizing power in a single class representative for most of the program!

            Beyond word frequencies, I explored contributions within the group. To my surprise, 
            Ghizlane Rehioui emerged as the most active participant, despite spending just a year with us. 
            She was followed by Chaymae Bennouri, who later became our class representative, and myself 
            (yes, I had my fair share of contributions too!). My data analysis revealed:
            - Total messages sent,
            - Media shared,
            - Links posted,
            ...and much more—detailed insights are in my presentation slides.

            ### Unveiling Our Conversations
            I delved deeper into when and how we communicated, uncovering peaks in activity during heated 
            discussions about deadlines or tests. One unforgettable moment was the debate on whether a key 
            exam should be held in December 2023 or January 2024—our group was truly on fire that day!

            Additionally, I mapped response patterns to identify interaction dynamics within the group. 
            Leveraging NMF for topic modeling, I uncovered recurring themes in our conversations, providing 
            a richer understanding of our shared journey.

            ### A Fond Farewell
            To my UM6P School of Collective Intelligence Class of 2024: you’ve made these years 
            unforgettable. This analysis, shared with your permission, is just a glimpse into our collective 
            experience.

            While this marks the end of one chapter, it’s also the start of another. I’ll be using weekends 
            to share my ongoing and completed projects. So, this isn’t just a goodbye—it’s Week 1 of a new 
            journey! Stay tuned, and thank you for being such an integral part of my story.

            With love and gratitude,  
            **[Your Name]**
