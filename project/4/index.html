            <p>
            Saying goodbye is never easy, especially when it’s to colleagues who’ve become like family. 
            As I bid farewell, I wanted this moment to reflect the vibrant memories we’ve shared and the 
            bonds we’ve built.
        
            <h3>The Inspiration Behind the Project</h3>
            As part of my NLP class presentation, I embarked on a heartfelt project inspired by our WhatsApp 
            group conversations. My goal was to create a digital reflection of our time together—capturing 
            our interactions, shared experiences, and the unique dynamics of our group.
        
            <h3>Unpacking the Data</h3>
            The journey began with extracting and cleaning our WhatsApp data, a challenge tackled using Regex. 
            From the refined dataset, I generated a word cloud that highlighted the most frequently used words. 
            Unsurprisingly, words like <strong>'class'</strong>, <strong>'thank you'</strong>, and <strong>'poll'</strong> stood out—reminders of our shared decision-making 
            moments and collective humor. 
        
            Our class decisions often revolved around polls, symbolizing our democratic spirit. Who could forget 
            our amusing reluctance to appoint a class representative for most of the program?
        
            <h3>Key Insights from the Data</h3>
            Beyond word frequencies, I analyzed group contributions and was surprised to discover:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most Active Member:</strong> Ghizlane Rehioui, despite spending just one year with us.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Contributors:</strong> Chaymae Bennouri (who later became our class representative) and myself.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement Metrics:</strong> Total messages sent, media shared, and links posted.</li>
            </ul>
            Detailed insights, including visualizations and statistics, can be found in my presentation slides.
        
            <h3>Unveiling Communication Patterns</h3>
            Diving deeper, I mapped our activity spikes and identified key moments when our group came alive—like 
            the fiery debate on whether an important exam should be scheduled in December 2023 or January 2024. 
            That day, our group chat was nothing short of electric!
        
            Using NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) for topic modeling, I uncovered recurring themes in our 
            conversations, offering a richer understanding of our shared experiences and priorities.
        
            <h3>A Heartfelt Farewell</h3>
            To my <strong>UM6P School of Collective Intelligence Class of 2024</strong>: thank you for making these years 
            so memorable. This analysis, shared with your permission, is a tribute to our shared journey.
        
            But this isn’t just a goodbye—it’s the start of a new chapter. I plan to dedicate weekends to sharing 
            more ongoing and completed projects. So, let’s call this <strong>Week 1 of a new journey!</strong> 
        
            <strong>Stay tuned, and thank you for being such an integral part of my story.</strong>
        
            With love and gratitude,
            <br><strong>BABATUNDE, Ibukun </strong>
